\begin{abstract}
        Since ancient times, people have longed to fly in the sky.  
        Actual flying involves risks and costs, but using a VR device makes it easy to experience flight.  
        In this study, we propose a method of presenting the sensation of flying with flapping virtual wings independent of the limbs, such as a flying lizard.  
        Unlike studies that presents the sensation of flapping wings by moving the arms, new applications that use the limbs during the flight experience can be expected by flying without moving the limbs.  
        In this paper, we proposed a method of presenting the sensation of manipulating the wings without using the limbs and a method of transmitting the force acting on the wing to humans.  
        We conducted experiments using these methods and obtained subjective evaluations.  
        % 
        From the experiment, it was confirmed that the operation by static muscle contraction is also effective for operationing wings.  
        It was also shown that the tactile presentation using EMS has a higher overall evaluation.  
        Finally, we obtained the result that the body image expansion of the virtual wing which proposed in this study is possible.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

        \fig{WingMan.pdf}{width=.9\hsize}{Flying with flapping virtual wings independent of the limbs}

        Since ancient times, people have longed to fly in the sky.  
        Until today, we have had a flight experience by using vehicles such as airplanes and hang gliders.  
        However, actual flying involves risks such as crashes, costs such as fuel, and the skill to operate the equipment.  
        By using Virtual Reality (VR) system, those risks and costs can be avoided, and makes it easy to experience flight.  

        Fig. 1 shows how they flying  with flapping virtual wings independent of the limbs.  
        In this study, we propose a method of presenting the sensation of flying with flapping virtual wings independent of the limbs as a reature with wings growing from the back of a human, as shown in Figure 1, using a VR system.  

        \subsection{Background and purpose of the study}
                
                Many studies have been conducted to give a sensation of "floating" of "flying" using VR devices.  
                Research on the sensation of falling generated by visual stimuli
                % \citation{奥川夏輝2017VR空間における視覚刺激によって発生する落下感覚の分析}
                and a proposal for a flight experience device using a body assistance mechanism
                % \cite{鈴木拓馬2014hmd}
                are examples.  

                Regarding research that gives a sensation of "flying with flapping", research has been conducted on a device that allows the user to board a large control device and experience a bird in flight.
                % \cite{rheiner2014birdly}
                This method has  disadvantages such as the need for a large scale device and the limitation of limbs movement.  

                In addition, there are still few studies on giving the sensation of flying with flapping one's wings.  
                In general, studies on giving the sensation of flying by becoming a bird have been conducted, and studies on giving the sensation of flying by becoming a creature with wings independent of its limbs, such as a flying lizard, have not yet been focused on.

                In this study, we propose a method to present the sensation of flying with flapping wings bymanipulating the wings that grow from the back without using limbs movements.
                By not using limbs movements, it is possible to use hands and feet during the VR flight experience, such as throwing an object while flying, whick is expected to expand the range of the VR flight experience.

\section{BODY IMAGE EXPANSION}

        In this study, two elements are important: to make humans feel "wings" that do not originally exist (existence), and to present the sensation of "flying with flapping with one's wings" (movement).  
        In order to present these sensations, we focus on the expantion of the body image.  

        \subsection{body image}
                Humans have the ability to perceive their own body shape, which is called body image.  
                % \cite{head1911sensory}
                It allows us to ditinguish between ourselves and others.


                


This template provides authors with most of the formatting specifications needed for preparing electronic versions of their papers. All standard paper components have been specified for three reasons: (1) ease of use when formatting individual papers, (2) automatic compliance to electronic requirements that facilitate the concurrent or later production of electronic products, and (3) conformity of style throughout a conference proceedings. Margins, column widths, line spacing, and type styles are built-in; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document and are identified in italic type, within parentheses, following the example. Some components, such as multi-leveled equations, graphics, and tables are not prescribed, although the various table text styles are provided. The formatter will need to create these components, incorporating the applicable criteria that follow.

\section{PROCEDURE FOR PAPER SUBMISSION}

\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}

First, confirm that you have the correct template for your paper size. This template has been tailored for output on the US-letter paper size. 
It may be used for A4 paper size if the paper size setting is suitably modified.

\subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}

The template is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin in this template measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. Please do not revise any of the current designations

\section{MATH}

Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ?3.5-inch disk drive?.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ?Wb/m2? or ?webers per square meter?, not ?webers/m2?.  Spell out units when they appear in text: ?. . . a few henries?, not ?. . . a few H?.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: ?0.25?, not ?.25?. Use ?cm3?, not ?cc?. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use ?(1)?, not ?Eq. (1)? or ?equation (1)?, except at the beginning of a sentence: ?Equation (1) is . . .?

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ?data? is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ?o?.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ?inset?, not an ?insert?. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ?alternately? (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ?essentially? to mean ?approximately? or ?effectively?.
\item In your paper title, if the words ?that uses? can accurately replace the word ?using?, capitalize the ?u?; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ?affect? and ?effect?, ?complement? and ?compliment?, ?discreet? and ?discrete?, ?principal? and ?principle?.
\item Do not confuse ?imply? and ?infer?.
\item The prefix ?non? is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ?et? in the Latin abbreviation ?et al.?.
\item The abbreviation ?i.e.? means ?that is?, and the abbreviation ?e.g.? means ?for example?.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ?Heading 1?, ?Heading 2?, ?Heading 3?, and ?Heading 4? are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ?Fig. 1?, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}

      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ?Magnetization?, or ?Magnetization, M?, not just ?M?. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ?Magnetization (A/m)? or ?Magnetization {A[m(1)]}?, not just ?A/m?. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ?Temperature (K)?, not ?Temperature/K.?

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
